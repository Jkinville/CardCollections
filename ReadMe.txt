Project: Card Collection Tracker 
This is a project for all of those TCG players and collectors out there. This piece of software allows the users to input their collections into a set, track the number
of each card that they have, and the cards location I.E. Deck 1, binder 3. Since this is meant to be game agnostic the sets and cards must be input manually. This
program is currently a simple command line program. This is a spring in summer project that I will be working on to learn various platforms and improve my OOP programming 
abilities. This ReadMe file will act as both a readme and as my dev journal 
Update: 2/22/2017
Added basic search and sort functionality. Implemented search in the form of bianry search, since the data will always be sorted before beaing searched this has the best time
complexity. For a sort function I used an insertion sort, since the arrays will almost always be sorted outside of starting a new array I think this had the best time 
complexity, I would like to implement a way to sort new arrays though. Maybe sort after every new item is added? 
Planned changes:
Multiplatform GUI with Qt
Improved search and sorting performance
Better data saving
Better inline documentation
