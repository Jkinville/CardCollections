Project: Card Collection Tracker 
This is a project for all of those TCG players and collectors out there. This piece of software allows the users to input their collections into a set, track the number
of each card that they have, and the cards location I.E. Deck 1, binder 3. Since this is meant to be game agnostic the sets and cards must be input manually. This
program is currently a simple command line program. This is a spring in summer project that I will be working on to learn various platforms and improve my OOP programming abilities.

Planned changes:
Multiplatform GUI with Qt
Improved search and sorting performance
Better data saving
